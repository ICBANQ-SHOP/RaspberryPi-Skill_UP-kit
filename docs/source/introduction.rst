Introduction
============

Raphael Kit is a Raspberry Pi learning kit that contains almost all kinds of components, especially a camera module and a speaker, which can realize functions such as monitoring system, voice broadcast and smart doorbell.

It contains a lot of commonly used input and output components and modules, as well as some basic electronic components (such as resistors and capacitors), which can provide powerful help for your programming learning.


Contains 4 programming languages: Python, C, Scratch and Java (processing). There are a total of 133 projects for you to choose from.

C and Python projects are arranged according to component types. C language projects have three categories: **Input**, **Output** and **Extension**, while Python projects have 2 more categories, **Audiovisual** and **IoT**, and 6 more expansion projects.

Scratch and Java have only arranged some sample projects according to the degree of difficulty of the project because of the compatibility of the IDE.

Each project introduces the required components, implementation steps, and code explanations, so that even if you have no programming or circuit knowledge, you can complete each project and expand on it.

If you want to learn another projects which we donâ€™t have, please feel free to send Email and we will update to our online tutorials as soon as possible, any suggestions are welcomed.
